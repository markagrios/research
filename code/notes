NOTES

Not sure if matrix -> list of simplices -> my python code is feasible to be just one program because I'm not that good, especially for directed graphs with directed cliques.

How can we make persistence that makes sense when not limiting ourselves to the connection matrix? Or better yet have a general model that under certain parameters will give what the original model that just used the matrix

Still need the path persistence....
